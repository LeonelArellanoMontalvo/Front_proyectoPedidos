## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant crimson (#D7263D) to evoke a sense of culinary passion and excitement.
- Background color: Light grayish-red (#F7E9EB), offering a subtle backdrop that keeps the crimson tones inviting rather than overwhelming.
- Accent color: A light pink (#F2B8B5), a softened version of the primary hue to offer a complementary but non-competing focus for secondary actions and details.
- Body: 'Inter', sans-serif, which offers excellent readability in digital interfaces, is suitable for body text.
- Headlines: 'Belleza', humanist sans-serif, gives the titles and section headers a polished yet organic touch.
- Use clean, outlined icons to represent menu categories and order statuses.
- Employ a responsive, grid-based layout to ensure compatibility across various devices.  Prioritize clear navigation for both customers and administrators.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance user experience.
